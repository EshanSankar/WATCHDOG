# WATCHDOG: Modular Real-Time Digital Twins for Intelligent Fault Monitoring & Handling in Robotics Workflows
This project ties in with the [Catalyst-OT2-xArm chemistry workflow orchestrator system](https://github.com/EshanSankar/catalyst-OT2-xArm).

This README is activately being updated. For an overview of this project, please refer below and to Catalyst-OT2-xArm.

## Overview
WATCHDOG integrates with a self-driving lab (SDL) chemistry workflow orchestrator, which uses Opentrons OT2 and UFACTORY xArm6 robots, to provide real-time safety validation and control.

## Dependencies
WATCHDOG depends on and integrates with several open-source software packages:
- [Catalyst-OT2-xArm](https://github.com/EshanSankar/catalyst-OT2-xArm) and its associated dependencies
- [ROS 2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html)
- [NVIDIA Isaac Sim 4.5.0](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacSim)
- [FoundationPoseROS2](https://github.com/ammar-n-abbas/FoundationPoseROS2)
- [bagrag](https://github.com/EshanSankar/bagrag) (NOTE: currently in-development)
